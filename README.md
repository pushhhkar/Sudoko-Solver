# Sudoko-Solver

<!-- This project is a solution to the classic Sudoku puzzle using a backtracking algorithm. The solver is designed to solve any standard 9x9 Sudoku grid, ensuring that each row, column, and 3x3 sub-grid contains all digits from 1 to 9 without repetition. The algorithm attempts to fill in the empty cells of the grid recursively, using logical constraints to backtrack when an invalid number is placed. -->
